komplex
=======

Komplex is easy-to-use strongly-typed build system for kotlin. Well, sort of :)


History
=======

This project began as a DSL demo for a presentation, but as I got into building something looking realistic,
I found that I really like it. So it is possible I can actually make a build system that doesn't make us cry :)

What I want?
=============

* Build script is just a program in Kotlin, so we can use all language features.
* DSL makes it looking similar to gradle and other build systems, operating in project/target/artifact domain.
* Easy to use without any central repository across multiple projects.
* Easy to setup team/company repository, integrate with CI, fetch and publish, locate sources.
* IDE can fetch all required data from the script to build project model.
* Pluggable architecture, so that we can add tools as needed.

Name?
=====

I'm still looking for better name. Below are some ideas.

* Kradle
* Kraken
* Komposer

When?
=====

No idea, as time permits.

Kontribute
==========

Right now I will not accept source code contributions, but you are welcome to discuss it in issues.
As soon as I make it build at least itself - I will be open for community involvement.
